# Installation

Installation for PHP 7.1 and later (PHP 8 as well):

```bash
composer require rawr/t-regx
```

# API

You, choose the interface:

- I choose to **keep PHP methods** *(but protected from errors)*:

  [Scroll to see](#no-change-in-api) - `preg::match_all()`, `preg::replace_callback()`, `preg::split()`
- I choose the **modern regex API**:

  [Scroll to see](#written-with-clean-api) - `pattern()->test()`, `pattern()->match()`, `pattern()->replace()`

For legacy projects, we suggest `preg::match_all()`, for standard projects, we suggest `pattern()`.

# Current work in progress

Current development priorities, regarding release of 1.0:

- Separate SafeRegex and CleanRegex into to two packages, so users can choose what they want #103
- Add documentation to each T-Regx public method #17 \[in progress]
- Release 1.0
- Revamp of [t-regx.com](https://t-regx.com/) documentation \[in progress]

# Documentation

Full API documentation is available at [t-regx.com](https://t-regx.com/). List of changes is available
in [ChangeLog.md](https://github.com/T-Regx/T-Regx/blob/develop/ChangeLog.md).

# Why T-Regx stands out?

:bulb: [See documentation at t-regx.com](https://t-regx.com/)

* ### No change in API!
    * You can use T-Regx safe features and exception-based error handling, without changing your API.

      Simply swap `preg_match()` to `preg::match()`, and your method is safe! Arguments and return types remain the
      same.

* ### Prepared patterns

  Using user data (for example with `preg_quote()`) isn't always safe with PCRE, as well as just not being that
  convenient to use. T-Regx provides `Pattern::inject()` and `Pattern::bind()` methods, designed specifically for
  handling potentially unsafe data. `Pattern::format()` allows converting user-supplied masks into full-fledged patterns
  safely.

* ### Working **with** the developer
    * Errors:
        * Not even touching your error handlers **in any way**
        * Converts all PCRE notices/error/warnings to exceptions
        * Preventing fatal errors
    * Strings:
        * [Tracking offset](https://t-regx.com/docs/replace-match-details) and subjects while replacing strings
        * [Fixing error with multi-byte offset (utf-8 safe)](https://t-regx.com/docs/match-details#offsets)

* ### Automatic delimiters for your pattern
  Surrounding slashes or tildes (`/pattern/` or  `~patttern~`) are not compulsory.

* ### Converting Warnings/Errors to Exceptions
    * Malformed patterns in `preg_()` methods don't make `preg_last_error()` to return error.
    * Notices, warnings or errors during `preg::` are converted to exceptions.
    * `preg_()` can never fail, because it throws `PregException` on warning/error.
    * In some cases, `preg_()` methods might fail, return `false`/`null` and **NOT** trigger a warning. Separate
      exception,
      `SuspectedReturnPregException` is then thrown by T-Regx.

* ### Written with clean API
    * Descriptive, chainable interface
    * SRP methods
    * UTF-8 support out-of-the-box
    * `No Reflection used`, `No (...varargs)`, `No (boolean arguments, true)`, `(No flags, 1)`
      , `[No [nested, [arrays]]]`

* ### Protects your from fatal errors
  Certain arguments cause fatal errors with `preg_()` methods. T-Regx will throw a catchable exception, instead of a
  Fatal Error.

## About coverage

We achived 100% coverage in T-Regx something about a year ago. We developed our library with the most rigorous TDD we
could achieve, and got to 97% pretty easily. Then we used coverage to find the cases that weren't covered, and written
unit tests, interaction tests and feature tests for those. And we didn't do that to bump the coverege, no, we did that
to ensure the contracts and behaviours in the application, and most importantly, to reduce bugs. We think we did well.

But now that we had 100% coverage, it became useless. I mean, yes, it was 100% but what could we do with it? When we had
less than 100% at least we could use it to find places which aren't covered, we knew we squrewed up and had to look for
more behaviorus and contracts to test. Now that we have 100%, we can't use it anymore. It became useless.

In order to make coverage usable again, we excluded feautre tests and integration tests from the coverage reports. The
tests are still being run by us during the development, and they still run in the CI, but we're ignoring it in the
coverage. Only unit tests are covered by the coverage now. The second we did that, the coverage dropped to 60%. That's
good, it gives us two things! First, it lets us know that not only everything is covered by feature tests and
integration tests, but also more than half of the library is covered in unit tests. Secondly, now we exactly know what
parts of the application aren't covered by unit tests. We can use it! Now, the coverage can actually help us again. When
we cover more cases with unit tests and reach 100% again, then sadly, coverage will cease to be a useful tool for good
and we'll probably dismiss using it.
